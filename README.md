# Space Travel Website Project ðŸš€âœ¨

:wave: Welcome to the Space Travel Website project, which is a part of a challenge by Frontend Mentor in collaboration with Scrimba and Kevin Powell.

### Project description ðŸ“œ

This project involves building a multi-page website that showcases various aspects of space travel, including destinations, crew members, and technology. The challenge is to recreate the provided designs, ensuring optimal layout across different devices. I decided to develop the project using Vue.js. In the project I set up a reusable CSS file with utility classes allowing us easy site redesigns and changes. Additionally, I added text & image animations using CSS. 

Mobile, tablet and desktop layout ideas, as well as text and image content were provided by the Frontend Mentor.
